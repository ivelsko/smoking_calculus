# Calculus from Middenbeemster with & w/o pipe notches (smokers/non-smokers) 

This repository is for keeping somewhat organized the data processing and analysis 
for investigating whether the microbiome in archaeological dental calculus differs 
between individuals who have pipe notches (presumed smokers) and individuals who 
don't (presumed non- or passive smokers). This includes sequencing statistics, 
mapping, etc., analyses.


## Overview about the repository

* `00-documentation`: files with general information about the samples and
  sequencing data
* `02-scripts.backup`: scripts for sample processing and analysis
* `05-results.backup`: results from the data analysis that can stand alone,
  meaning they aren't strictly used as input for another step
